The goal of this project is to provide a python package
that allows to calculate linear regressions on data sets with uncertainties.
Linear regressions can be performed for correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties.
The calculations follow the methodology published by
[Mahon (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00206819709465336).
Typographical errors that were made in that work have been corrected.
A method to allow calculating a linear regression through a fixed point,
avoiding previously made errors,
is also provided.

## Installation

The package can be installed from `pypi` via:

```
pip install mahon
```

## Usage

Below is an example on how to use the package.

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from mahon import LinReg

>>> # some data
>>> xdata = np.array([1, 2, 3.1, 4.9])
>>> ydata = np.array([1.1, 1.9, 3, 5.5])

>>> # some uncertainty and correlation
>>> xunc = 0.05 * xdata
>>> yunc = 0.073 * ydata
>>> rho = np.zeros_like(xdata) + 0.5

>>> # do regression
>>> my_reg = LinReg(xdata, xunc, ydata, yunc, rho)

>>> # print out the parameters and their uncertainties
>>> my_reg.slope
(0.9983617286559998, 0.0684389236571533)
>>> my_reg.intercept
(0.05545339135826666, 0.11811730191506546)
>>> my_reg.mswd
2.5105964767246842
```

Detailed example on how to use the class for fitting and plotting the results
can be found
[in this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/galactic-forensics/mahon/tree/main/examples).


## Development & Contributing

If you would like to contribute,
clone the GitHub repo and then install the package locally from within the folder via:

```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

If you also want to install the full test environment,
run:

```
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

Code auto formatting is implemented using
[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.
Full testing of the package can be done with
[`nox`](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html).

Please feel free to raise issues on GitHub
and open pull requests if you have a feature to be added.
Tests and adequate docstrings should be provided along with your new code.
